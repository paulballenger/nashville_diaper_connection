## Introduction
By using data supplied by [Nashville Diaper Connection](https://www.nashvillediaperconnection.org/) is one of over 300 diaper banks in the U.S. that distributes diapers to families in need. Diapers are not covered by federal aid programs such as food stamps, WIC (women, infants, an children), or SNAP. Money from TANF (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) can be used for buying diapers, but TANF funds max out at $270/month for families in Tennessee and also are used for other necessities such as food, rent/mortgage, utilities, medical expenses, transportation, etc.

By using internal data providied by Nashville Diaper Connection along with outside data from U.S. Census, the State of TN, the National Diaper Bank Network, and various reports and surveys, I analyzed the demographics of low-income families who have a need for diapers along with the impact that NDC has on middle TN by supplying the diapers.
