## Introduction

[Nashville Diaper Connection](https://www.nashvillediaperconnection.org/) is a diaper bank, which is an organization that provides diapers to families in need. It is one of 5 diaper banks in Tennessee, and the only one in middle Tennessee.

In the analysis, I looked at 3 things:
* Diaper need and why is exists
* The demographics of poverty in middle TN
* Nashville Diaper Connection impact on alleviating diaper need

## Inspiration

The reason I chose to work with Nashville Diaper Connection is because I know the founder and have watched the growth of his organization since its founding in 2013, and I was also drawn by the chance to work on a real-life scenario.
